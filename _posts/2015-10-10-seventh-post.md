title: Week 7 – Blue Paint Shower
---
Hello, freedom (almost).

Week 7 is the week of the first exam. Because of that, we didn’t have lecture on Friday, and man was that awesome! Also, I made some stupid mistakes on the exam, but that’s just boring, so I’m not going to go over that. You just need to know that I’m sad…

Anyway, let’s go over the lectures. Actually, let me just talk about the Wednesday lecture as it was more interesting. Downing talked about constant variables and went over a series of valid and invalid combinations of variables and pointers. I already had a pretty good understanding on this topic, but having Downing going over it is always a plus as he can always find a way to make you think. And it was so worth it. The best part, though, was his paintball gun analogy at the end of the class. Here’s the general rule of Downing’s paintball game: a paintball gun can point at anyone, but it can never shoot at a woman. In other words, you can only point at the ladies if the gun is not loaded. So, let the game begin.

May the odds be ever in your favor.

A regular pointer is like a regular paintball gun. It can point to anyone who is male and can change its target. A pointer that points to a constant is a paintball gun that has no ammo, so it can point to anyone including the gals. A constant pointer that points to a constant is a special paintball gun that locks onto a single target, but because it doesn’t have any ammo, it can point to anyone. The difference is that Downing cannot change the target after the gun has assigned to a target.

Then there’s the best kind of special gun – the one that mimics a constant pointer. This is the paintball gun that has ammo, which means it can only points at the guys, and once it has locked on to its target, it cannot shoot at anyone else. And here’s what Downing decided to do:

“I picked [Joaquin]( http://ace-jc.github.io/about/), and I blow the hell out of him!” 

Okay, maybe Downing didn’t use those exact words, but you get the idea. RIP Joaquin. Hello Joaquin the Smurf!

See you at the virtual paintball field.

**Tip of the Week**: 

If you are a man and see Downing holding a paintball gun, RUN!

**Tip of the Week 2**:

Did you know that the new multiplayer mode in Halo 5, Breakout, is inspired by paintball? Also, Halo 5 is coming out soon! #HUNTtheTRUTH
