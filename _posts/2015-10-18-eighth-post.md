title: Week 8 – A Sad Man Writing…
---

Hello, Allocator.

Yes, that’s the name of project 3, and my partner and I are working on it. We are doing fine so far, although we are facing an “interesting” bug. At least that’s what, I think, Mike Scott would say.

Anyway, let’s dive into the lectures from this past week. We went over the project for the first two lectures. Downing talked about memory allocation and why delete could cause problems. For instance, if a program deletes too early, too late, or simply just deletes the wrong address, it can create a lot of problems. This really shouldn’t be new to anyone though. If you want to erase a specific word on your paper, you wouldn’t want to erase the word before or the blank line after it hoping that the word would just magically disappear, right? Anyway, thinking in binary is not required for this.

We went over function defaults on Friday. I had never seen a function using a default argument before, so it was totally new to me. That being said, the idea is not too hard to grasp and I already can’t wait to try it myself. Personally, I think it’s a neat way to do function overloading, but I’m sure there’s more to it than just that.

We also got our exam grade back on Saturday, and man am I upset. Although the test was fair, I somehow managed to lose a significant amount of points on the exam. I know I made two mistakes on the last two questions which would break my methods entirely; however, they are still very minor mistakes and can be easily caught by the compiler. Because of that, I highly doubt that they are the reason of why I did poorly, at least that’s what I am hoping as Downing does not seem like an instructor who expects everyone to be perfect in writing code on paper. After all, he is the teacher of a class called “Object-Oriented Programming,” not POP – Perfection-Oriented Programming. I really hope I can get my exam back as soon as possible so I can know what other mistakes I made.

Oh, and we only had one quiz on Friday. Odd.

Let’s hope the next time we meet I’d be in a better mood.

**Tip of the Week**: 

The spring course schedule is out. I don’t want to spoil too much, but if you really want to take a class that involves data (*cough cough), you may want to do some research. Just talk to your fellow CS people and they may give you some useful tips.
