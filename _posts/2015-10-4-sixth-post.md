title: Week 6 – The Little Greek Letter
---
Hello, people.

This past week was very light compared to the previous weeks. It is probably because there’s no project due and nothing much was going on in the CS department. Our first exam is coming though, and I have to admit that I’m a little stressed by it as I am not sure how I’m going to prepare for it.

Anyway, let’s talk about the lectures. This week we went over something that is new to me, and it’s called **Lambda Function**. I don’t know why it’s called that as it has nothing to do with the ancient civilization or mathematics in general (or at least that’s what I think). So what is it? In short, it is an anonymous function that can be passed around like a variable so other methods can use it to do whatever. I thought I understood it fairly well despite that fact that I think it’s totally weird; however, one of my classmates, Mr. Kolbly, managed to blow my mind once again. [Here](http://lkolbly.github.io/cs371p-web/2015/10/04/interface.html) is the link to the snippet of code he shows in his blog post. I have no idea what just happened, and I’ll definitely dedicate a good amount of time to get the bottom of it. That, or I may do poorly on the upcoming exam. (fingers crossed)

This is all I have for this past week as I can’t really think of more stuffs from the lectures to talk about. I did have a mini mental roller coaster ride though, but that is totally boring.

See you again soon (assuming I don’t bomb the exam).

**Tip of the Week**: 

I learned this from my HackTX last weekend. If you wanna create a local host for your html file, just go to the directory of the html file and type in this:
```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```
Then you can just go to the browser and type in http://localhost:8000/ to view your beautiful (or incredibly clean) web app!

*P.S.* Did you know that lambda was used as a shield pattern by the mighty Spartans? SPARTA!
