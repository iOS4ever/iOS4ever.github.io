title: Week 10 – Survival of the Fittest
---
Hello, survivors.

This past week was pretty interesting, and by interesting, what I really mean is that nothing crazy happened (except for the rain on Friday). We talked about the project on Monday, had a guest speaker from Mutual Mobile on Wednesday, and went over stack, again, on Friday.

So, what is this new project about? It’s called Darwin, and, as the name suggests, it simulates the interaction between different creatures in an environment. Well, calling it a simulator is a bit far-fetched as some creatures can infect the others to be the most successful creature in this world and eating the others is not an option. This project reminds me of the last project of CS 312 Introduction to Programming. The name of the project was “Critters” and it was the project that introduced many of us the idea of classes and object-oriented design. Of course, this project is much more complex as we have to create our own design and do everything from scratch, which makes it infinitely more fun than Critters. My partner and I are also planning on doing the extra credit – creating a “best” species that always wins the game – just for kicks.

I was actually going to post something about what I learned the past year and what I’ve been thinking for the past few months, but I just ran out of words to say and didn’t feel like posting it as it really wasn’t closely related to the class. Perhaps one day I’ll post something. Perhaps.

See you soon.

**Tip of the Week**: 

If you haven’t done any side project like me, try to start one! If you don’t have any idea or feel like you don’t know enough to make something interesting, it is a good idea to talk to your fellow classmates and learn from them. You will be amazed by what your peers have done. It is one of the reasons why I love UT Austin so much because I’m usually the dumbest one in the room, and boy is it awesome. It is probably the quickest way to improve yourself and pushes you forward.
