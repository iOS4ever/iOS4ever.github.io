title: Week 12 – the Meaning of Life
---

Hello, residents of Earth.

The end is near, and that means it’s time for the last project. The project is called “Life.” It is actually really similar to the last project Darwin. It is based on the Conway’s *Game of Life*. If you want to know more about it, here is a good [video]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2vgICfQawE) on it. But in a few words, it is a board game that follows a set of rules and changes the statuses of the cells. The best part about this assignment is that, just like Darwin, it focuses on design. The goal of this project is not about getting it to work, but about what you think is the best way to solve a set of problems, and boy I love this kind of projects.

So far, my favorite part of the last project, besides the coding part, is the puns on the class discussion board – Piazza. The worst part for me, however, is that it is the *last* project. Not only this means that final week is coming. It also signifies the end of the class. This is especially sad for me as I absolutely love OOP. I’ve learned so much in the past few months and I enjoy almost every minute of it (except the exam parts, of course). Let’s hope that I can get off the waitlist for Software Engineering so I can continue my learning spree!

**Tip of the Week**: 

Life is fragile. It’s really hard to not think about what effect a certain turn of events can have on us. Right now, I just wish we can all not only think about the people we care about, but also talk to them or be with them. I also can’t help but to think about the people who have lost their love ones. But I am trying really hard to not think about the people that we have lost. 

What I want to think about is that we are all different, yet the same. We are all humans.
