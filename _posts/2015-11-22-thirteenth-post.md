title: Week 13 – Cool Minds Don’t Think Alike… Yet
---

Hello, coders.

Week thirteen is now complete, and the last project has ended. If you read my last blog entry, you’d know how sad I’m about this. I still can’t believe that this semester is almost over. On the bright side, the weather is getting cooler and cooler, and boy I love it!

This past week we learned about pure virtual methods and virtual constructors and destructors. Although they are incredibly useful, I can’t help but to wonder how useful this information is outside of the C++ world. I guess I’ll find out soon. Oh, and the quizzes this past week were incredibly tricky in my opinion. Even if I did get the answers right, I felt like it was just pure luck, and I did use up my luck as I missed one of the questions on Friday.

Now, this week’s articles talked about women in computer science, and, as a human in CS, I’d love to share my two cents on the topic. However, because I need to manage some data for some hypothetical customers, I’ll have to wait until the Thanksgiving week to share my view on this topic. But for now, all I want to say is that I’m on Team Humans, and you, my fellow humans, can always count on me to be on your side, as long as you consider yourself as a human being. If you are interested in what I think about it, please come back next week.

Let’s build a better world together.

**Tip of the Week**: 

Do NOT trust the C++ STL. Sometimes it’s easier to manage memory yourself…

**Tip of the Week 2**: 

Try to ignore gender, race, religion, and ethnicity, and the world would be a better place.

**Tip of the Week 3**:

Do you know what would make a better world? A world without Orac… You know what, I gotta go.
