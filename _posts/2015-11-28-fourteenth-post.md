title: Week 14 – Human Engineers

You are watching a tech company’s presentation on their latest inventions with your daughter. Your daughter asks you, “why are most of the speakers men?” What would you say?

As promised, this is my thought on the gender “issue” in computer science. Although we are not supposed to have a blog entry for the Thanksgiving week, I have decided to write one anyway.

The computer science field, for whatever reasons, has way more men than women, and some people believe that this is a problem that we need to resolve as women are underrepresented; therefore, here at UT, we have an organization called Women in Computer Science and its job is to get more women into computer science. This actually isn’t unique to CS. This has been a hot topic for years in all of the STEM fields, although engineering and computer science are the two most extreme ones.

Many companies are trying really hard to hire more women and other minority groups. For example, Apple, under Tim Cook, has released a couple of diversity reports the past two years. Tim Cook mentioned in his message to the company that Apple has hired 65% more women this year than the previous year and insisted that there’s still a lot more that need to be done. [1]

Here is what I don’t really understand though. Yes, we have more men than women. But does it really matter? After all, that is just a number, and it is up to us to define it. As long as we give everyone an equal opportunity to succeed, why would we even care about the gender proportion? Diversity is great. Discrimination of any sort, even if it’s reverse, is *not*. Why can’t companies just hire the best engineers available? After all, aren’t we all humans? Why do we even care about gender in the first place? It is the 21st century. We should learn from our mistakes from the past, not to be overshadowed by it.

I truly believe that we don’t have much sexism here in UTCS, and our current method of getting more women into CS is not healthy. Why are we all here? Is it because of our differences, or is it because of what we share in common? Are women in CS just so they can balance the number? Are men in CS just so they can continue dominating the industry? Or are we here because we are interested in computer science and many of us want to change the world with our ideas? Why do we have to focus on our differences while we can celebrate our similarities? Why can’t we just come together and start building a better world together, as a species?

So does it mean that I think there’s absolutely no gender issue in the STEM fields? Well, not really. The problem does not lie in the hiring process. It does not lie in the gender of the person. The problem is not even the STEM fields themselves.

The issue is with the society.

As I said, we have made a lot of mistakes in the past as a nation and as a species, and there are consequences. Many millennials are raised by traditionalist (sexist) families. If a girl expresses her interests in computers or engineering, what would her parents say? Would her parents support her or talk her down? What if it’s worse? What if the girl never found out that she *is* interested in computer science, but because of the way she was raised, she became a nursing major instead (oh boy, aren’t I sexist…)? Let’s dig deeper.

What are the stereotypical toys parents buy for their kids? 

If you search girls’ toys at Target, you see Disney Princess and Barbie. If you search boys’ toys, it gives you Buzz Lightyear and Woody. You can see a similar trend if you search something analogous on Amazon.com. 

The problem is the idea the last generation imposed onto us.

It is the environment that we were raised in that made the difference, and that is what we need to fix.

(Although I do not recall my parents doing that to me when I was a kid. They didn’t buy car toys because I was a boy. They did it because I LOVE cars. Perhaps genetics also has something to do with it as evolution does play a role and… Nah, that’s too complicated. I’ll just leave that to the scientists)

We are not solving any issue by blindly putting more women in STEM. In fact, we are only creating more issues. If number 50 is equality and currently we have an average of 43, do we add more numbers over 50 to get that sweet spot, or do we remove the ones that are below 50 and add more 50s? We should never use sexism to counter sexism. If we do, we’d only create more problems in our society and the matter would get worse. We should not even think about gender.

Sexism is dead when we no longer cares about a person’s gender when we discuss his or her achievements. Sexism is dead when we stop making everything about gender. Sexism is dead when we work towards a common goal, as humans.

Do you know why I love space exploration so much? Astronomy is a humbling and character-building experience. It gives us a better perspective on our world and the issues we are facing. It shows how tiny and fallible we are. On the other hand, it also shows how amazing we are. We have the technology to observe this vast universe on this tiny planet called Earth. We get to send a robot out into deep space and make it turn around and take a picture of its birthplace. We are the greatest species on Earth and in this solar system. Not only that, we are probably one of the greatest species, if not *the* greatest species, in the Milky Way Galaxy (it’s not like I’m bias or something), and boy, that thought just gives me goose bumps. Every. Single. Time.

If you have ever faced any kind of discrimination, please do talk about it with your fellow Longhorns. We are all here to listen and, I guarantee you, we will do whatever we can to support you and fix the problem.

The fact that we are still talking about gender and race at UT really frustrates me as I love the people here. That being said, I’m still thankful. I’m incredibly thankful that the sexism I have seen so far at UTCS are mostly for the less worse reasons, but we still have a lot more work to do. It may be almost impossible to unite our species, but I accept this challenge.

My name is Jerry Pon, a human being. And I’m proud to be one.

P.S. Jackasses like Donald Trump and losers like ISIS are NOT humans. They are cancer cells, and we can only eradicate them if we work together.

Edit: just read Lane’s post on this, and, although he sounds totally sexist (seriously, he somehow noticed the MI6 agent in Skyfall was a female. I didn’t even think about it!), I highly recommend you to read it if you haven’t already. It can give you a slightly different perspective.
