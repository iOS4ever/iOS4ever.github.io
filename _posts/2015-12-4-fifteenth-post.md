title: Week 15 – Thoughts on CS 371p
---

Hello, fellow OOPers.

This is it. This is the end of the chapter. 

In my first blog entry, I talked about this class’s format and how curious I’m in finding out what kind of programmer this class would turn me into. Well, I think I have the answer now.

The answer is I’m not sure. In other words, I technically don’t have the answer. All I know is that I enjoy the class a lot, but I’m not sure how helpful the knowledge I absorbed this past semester really is in the future. I feel like I learned more about C++ rather than object oriented programming, and given the class itself being called OOP, I’m wondering if it is false advertising.

Here are what I love about this course. Downing is a fantastic instructor. He is crystal clear on the material and just an awesome person overall. I also love how he is willing to try out new things for the course like taking the exam electronically to make the course better for both the students and the teaching staff. The class is well organized and the projects are not overly complicated and incredibly fun to do. These are the things that I like about the course, but let’s move on to what can make it even better.

Sadly, just like most of the other classes in CS, OOP has useless examinations. There are two exams and many quizzes, and they worth a whopping 65% of your final grade. For a programming-centric class, I think this is simply odd. The strangeness does not end there. There are five projects for this class (only 35% of the final grade), but the first project is to get the students familiar with the language and the tools we use for the class, which is great. However, the second and third projects are not design problems and the third project is not even OOP. Only the final two projects focus on design and the fundamentals of OOP.

I strongly think that exams only work for classes that are theory-centric like CS 439. For classes that are programming-centric, there should not be any exam as it is meaningless. I’m not getting into why standardized testing is idiotic as this is not the right place to talk about it. Although I do want to say that our grade is supposed to reflect what we’ve learned and the grade does not take into account the experience the students received by missing a question on the test. 

Just think about this. We learn the most by actually applying the concepts, not by writing them on paper or in a web browser without a compiler. I mean, how can anyone write code without checking it? The fact that we cannot compile our code and debug it on the exam is just unacceptable. An exam should never make a student write code without a compiler because everyone makes mistakes, and it’s simply not how the real world works. Furthermore, this class encourages us to use supposedly the tools of the trade in the real world like version control and unit testing, and yet, the majority of our grade is determined by not being able to even compile the code we write. Weird.

Let me head back to the project part. This class spent the majority of the time talking about C++ instead of OOP, and the exams are really not helping, if not making it worse. To make this class better, I suggest to eliminate the exams completely, keep the quizzes but lower the weight, and increase the number of projects to 7 as the students no longer have to waste time memorizing syntax and can actually spend time coding. The first project should be assigned the first full week of the semester and due a week after as students really only need one week to work on it. In addition, there should be two additional projects after project 5 “Life,” and they should focus much more on OOP. Perhaps project 6 can utilize shared_pointer and project 7 can be something interesting.

Here is what my ideal OOP class is like. The quizzes worth 15% of the grade and are given almost every class day. The rest of the grade is determined by the 7 projects. The first project is about getting used to the tool, the following two projects are about getting more familiar with C++, and the rest of the semester focuses on OOP. Of course, this awesome class needs to be taught by Glenn Downing.

Remember: grade is supposed to reflect how much the students have learned, not how many mistakes they have made.

This class is still special to me. It is the most enjoyable CS class I’ve ever taken here at UT, and it is also the only class that actually made me seriously considering being a TA of. Furthermore, Downing can always find a way to make me think about stuffs. Sometimes it’s CS-related while the other times are just, well, life-related, perhaps? For example, I’m totally not a writer, but somehow I kind of enjoy writing blogs now. I also kind of like being questioned during the lecture. Why? How did this happen? Well, let’s hope I can get off the waitlist for software engineering so I can find out the answers. Although I’m pretty sure the highest grade I can get for that class would probably be a B.

We are all proud of the fact that what starts here changes the world here at UT Austin. Perhaps it’s time for us to change the system we currently have so we can do exactly that.

TL; DR: I highly recommend the course as you’d learn a lot; however, the grading is broken.

Maybe we’ll meet again. Happy holidays everyone!

Peace.

**Tip of the Week**:

Swift, the programming language, is now open-source! Check it out: [https://github.com/apple/]{https://github.com/apple/}

**Tip of the Week 2**:

It turns out that listening to music with lyrics while you’re writing something can create some weird grammatical errors. I just learned my mistake...

**Tip of the Week 3**:

As promised, I wrote a blog last week about gender equality. I really did it for myself as a reminder of why I do what I do, but if you’re interested, feel free to click [here]{ http://ios4ever.github.io/fourteenth-post/}.
