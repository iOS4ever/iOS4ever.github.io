title: Week 3 – We Mean Business
---
Hello, job seekers.

It’s that time of the week again where I get to write a bunch of words and you can read a bunch of them. Yay!

This week is very different in OOP because we only had one lecture from Dr. Downing, and that means we only had one quiz. Yes! 

We took a day off on Monday as it was Labor Day and had a guest speaker on Wednesday. The guest speaker was Chris Martin from Bloomberg, and he talked about what Bloomberg really is – a software company – and gave us some tips on résumé writing. He also gave us a glimpse of Bloomberg’s recruiting process. For example, in an interview, the interviewee needs to be able to talk about what he or she has done and explains it in depth. If someone can’t articulate it well, it implies lack of knowledge or confidence, and they tend to stay away from that kind of person. Although he talked a lot about Bloomberg and what they do as a “software company,” I feel that it still doesn’t say much about the company itself, e.g. how they operate and what they believe in. At the end of the day, I still see Bloomberg as a financial company. They just “need” software to excel at their job and they happen to provide their own program; therefore, they consider themselves a software company.

Friday was not bad either. We went over exception handling in C++, which is really similar to Java. I believe this is most likely a review for most people in class as the try-catch blocks helped us write a lot of tests for the projects in CS 314 Data Structures. That being said, I still learned something new about exception handling and pass-by reference, which can make your brain go into neutral gear sometimes. What’s great about the lecture is that Dr. Downing can always find a way to push my brain to the redline. His lecture always shows off something new to me and makes me think about what really is going on behind the fancy things I utilized in other classes, and that’s what I love about this class so far because this is why I fell in love with computer science in the first place. 

One of the quiz questions was not very ideal, though, as it is very subjective and I do disagree with the answer of the question. Still, I guess it’s a good way to force myself into learning how others code and maybe I can get more valuable experience from it. Again, I’ll have to wait until the future to see how useful it actually is.

**Tip of the Week**:
When in doubt, double check.

If you think there’s something wrong with your code submission, check it again. You can make the most efficient and beautiful program on Earth, but if it can’t make its way to your audience, it is all pointless. Sometimes, OCD is good for you. (Although most of the times it isn’t especially for us programmers, but that’s a story for another day)

P.S. See that my tip of the week title is now bolded? Fancy, right? I know.
