title: Week 5 - Per aspera ad astra
---
Hello fellow Earthlings. 

This week was incredibly long and interesting as it was the start of a new chapter of my life. Monday was all about getting jobs. Yup, I skipped all of my classes on Monday like a good CS Longhorn, so technically it's not part of the OOP experience, but I'm just going to talk about it because why not. After all, it's about sharing my experience with my fellow CS people. 

So, before the career fair, there was a CS career brunch and I was lucky enough to be invited. I had never been to the Darrell K Royal–Texas Memorial Stadium before, so being there alone was already an unique experience. The main purpose of the brunch, of course, is to allow us CS majors and the companies to know more about each other and hopefully nurture some beneficial relationships. There were about 400 students and more than 40 employers there. It may seem like an awesome opportunity for us to advertise ourselves, and in many ways it does, but the place was so noisy, thanks to all the humans talking in a closed space, I basically had to shout to have a conversation, and man did it exhaust me. I pretty much lost my voice after it. That wasn't the biggest drawback of it though. When they said brunch, I actually expected good food being served there. It turned out that there was only some bagels and terrible coffee. Luckily, no one went there just for the food. 

Then there's the career fair. This was my second career fair, but my first serious one. This time, I had a better resume, and I was thirsty for an internship. There were companies making programs for their pilots. There were companies wanting programmers to help defending the nation. There was a company that writes code for the nuclear weapons. Then there was a company that writes software for Curiosity and curiosity. 

Of course, I'm talking about *JPL* - Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

I had the longest and the most fun conversation with Alex from JPL. It is really cool to know that even the elite programmers make very similar mistakes to us noobies’. Not only it humanized them, but also raised my confidence level – even I can have the opportunity to work there!  What's even cooler is that JPL doesn't code to make money. They code to advance, and even unite, the human species. This also leads me to the Wednesday class. We had a guest speaker on Wednesday, and, to my surprise, it was Alex. As a CS major who is really interested in space exploration, I was like a kid in a candy store being told that I can have all the candies for free.

Awesome. 

Alex talked about the OPS LAB, the software they build for the rovers and what user centered design is. In short, JPL cares about building the right thing, and that’s totally understandable when your program runs the machine that is operating on a planet that’s not Earth. Here’s my summary for the lecture. Don’t ever just think blindly. Always try to bring out your ideas and try them out. You never know how stupid they really are unless you have actually given them a shot. 

It's difficult to get a job. It's even more difficult to do what you love to do and still get paid. However, it doesn't mean that we shouldn't be trying. Our dreams may be naïve or even stupid, but it's better than no goal to pursue at all. I may not be able to work for the companies I like right away, but I'll definitely keep trying. 

I’ll end it with a quote from Alex that sums up everything very well:

“*As developers, we have a finite number of commits before we expired*.”

P.S. I am writing this on my iPhone while riding the bus, so if there's any misspelled word or error, please feel free to tell me. Thanks!
