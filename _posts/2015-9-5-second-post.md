title: Week 2 – Collatz
---
Hello, fellow humans.

This week of class is all about the first project – Collatz. The program is based on the Collatz conjecture. If you don’t know what it is, I am pretty sure Wikipedia has an awesome article on it. That being said, I’ll still explain it for those of you who are too lazy to type. If you take a positive natural number and it’s even, divide it by 2. If it’s odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1 to it. The Collatz conjecture states that if you repeat this process, you will always end up with 1 with a certain number of cycles. The program is supposed to calculate the maximum cycle length of a range of numbers and returns it. 

The purpose of this project is likely for us to understand the tools we will be using for the future projects. It acts as a training ground for the students to get used to the tools that are required for the class. It also forces me to not rush through the set up of the assignment, which I tend to do as I usually like to jump right into the coding part, and that’s a good thing. As the projects get bigger and more complex, setting up the development environment only gets more crucial. Picking the right tool for the right job can make the problem solving much more efficient and less demanding for the programmers.

In short, this week of class is all about the set up of a project. It gives us a way to be better programmers so we can be ready for the upcoming challenge. We also went over a lot of ideas on improving the performance of the program and the limitation of those algorithms, which is really like the class “Data Structure” if you ask me. 

Now, would you excuse me, I need to get back into my coding mode.

See you starside.
