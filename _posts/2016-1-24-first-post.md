title: Week 1 - Hello
---
Hello, everyone.

The first school week of 2016 is over, and it’s time to talk about one of the classes I’m taking this semester – Software Engineering.

This class is taught by the same professor as my Object-Oriented Programming class from last semester, Professor Downing; therefore, I’ve decided to use the same blog from OOP to share my experience in the class. 

Since this is the first week, Downing gave us three questions to answer for our very first blog post, which is new as he did not give us anything similar last semester, and this is good as I had no idea what to write for the first week especially when I already know what to expect from the class.

Without further due, let me start answering the questions.

**What did you do this past week?**

Well, not much really. I spent the majority of the time doing nothing as classes were just getting started and I was trying the use the last free time I had to do some non-academic things.

**What’s in your way?**

This semester actually holds a lot of challenges for me. Despite the fact that I survived CS 439 last Spring, this semester could probably be the toughest one yet. There are multiple reasons. 

Firstly, I’m taking algorithm, which is the hardest theory course we have to take here at UTCS, and since I’m not a big fan of theory courses, I do not look forward to it.

Secondly, I’ll have to spend a lot of time outside of the class to work on the projects for two classes: one being this class, another one being Mobile News App Design, in which each group is supposed to make an iOS app and submit it to the App Store by the end of the semester. The good thing is that I’m highly interested in these two classes, and I really can’t wait to start working on the projects. 

Lastly, I got a part-time job for this semester, and, as much as I want to learn from this tremendous opportunity, I really fear that I won’t be able to balance work and school.

In short, this is probably the semester that will most likely kill me. Let’s see if I can survive.

**What will you do next week?**

Well, besides that I’ll start working, I think I’ll start studying for my classes just like everyone else. Maybe I’ll play some Halo 5 if I have some free time, but that’s really unlikely. Oh, and for those of you who don’t know, I’m a [Spartan]( http://halo.wikia.com/wiki/SPARTAN_Program).

So, a new year, a new semester, a (semi-)new blog, and a new chapter has started. I didn’t really have any new year resolution. My biggest goal for this semester is really just trying to survive.

I’ll see you soon.

**Tip of the Week**:

If you are new to Python like me, you may find the Python documentation helpful. I found myself spending most of the time learning the data structures in Python for the first assignment “Collatz.” 

Here is the site: https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/datastructures.html

**Tip of the Week 2**:

If you are interested in what Downing’s Object-Oriented Programming class is like and what I think about it, please feel free to go back to my blog homepage. Perhaps it can give you an idea of what Downing is like and what to expect from this class. Spoiler alert though
