title: Week 2 – Don’t Shoot
---
Hello, readers.

Python sure is an interesting language. I’m still not quite used to its syntax, and the way it uses for loop is just weird. The fact that you need to use a range object with a for-each loop for something incredibly simple is still strange to me. Nevertheless, I think it is a cool language to learn.

The first project is due soon, and frankly, I have been pretty much done with it for a good week. The problem is that the online judge we’re using, Sphere, is not playing nice. So far, no one has a solution that is accepted on Sphere, even Professor Downing’s. In fact, Sphere is not accepting my C++ solution that worked just a few months ago. I’m not sure what is going to happen, but I guess we may just have to drop Sphere for now. This is what happens when you use Russian software! (JK)

Let me fast forward to Friday. Downing talked about exception in Python. Except for the fact that Python uses a very different syntax, it is pretty much the same as any other popular languages. Downing, once again, gave us one of the most awesome analogies for exception, and one of my favorites.

Here is what I learned. You have to choose your life partner carefully. And then, if your partner does start to annoy you, do not remain silent or overreact to it. Try to talk about it with your partner and the annoyance may just stop, and everyone lives happily ever after. Although we are in Texas, sometimes we just can’t shoot our way out.

What does it have to do with exception, you ask? Well, you don’t want me to spoil the fun, do you?

Now, let’s all get a job next week, shall we?

**Tip of the Week**:

Google has made something awesome called [AlphaGO]( https://www.facebook.com/verge/videos/1029273450442331/). It is an AI that masters the ancient Chinese chess game called [Go]( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game)). Most AIs use the old fashion brute-force method to win a game; however, Go simply has way too many possibilities for that to work. It sure is interesting to see how Google tackled that problem and showed off this modern AI technology. The future sure is now. How exciting!
