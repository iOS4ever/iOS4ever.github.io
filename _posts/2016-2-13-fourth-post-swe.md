title: Week 4 – Netflix
---

Hello, binge-coders.

**Binge-coding**, coding for a long period of time in one sitting.
 
Project 2 Netflix has been released. What we need to do is to create a program that can predict a user’s ratings on movie titles with the given data set. To get the full credits, our program needs to be fast and accurate enough. It seems like a really interesting project as finding the right formula for it could be a challenge. I feel like it’s going to come down to trials and errors at the end to get the smallest RMSE though. My partner and I haven’t started the project yet as we have been pretty busy lately. Hopefully we will be able to find a good time to binge-code this project.

I almost forgot to mention that we finally got our first guest speaker for this semester! These guest lectures are one of my favorite things about Downing’s classes because I love learning from others’ experience, and you just don’t know what you can get out of the lecture. It’s like opening a present!

I think I just ran out of things to talk about for this week’s entry. I guess this is why Downing wants us to answer those three questions for this semester’s blog posts. That’s actually really brilliant.

**What did you do this past week?**

Hmmm… Well, I didn’t do much for this class really. I spent most of my time doing homework for other classes, and that’s about it.

**What’s in your way?**

Everything! I have an economics exam coming up on Monday, so I really need to study for it. Not only that, I have algorithm homework due on Wednesday, Netflix project due on Thursday, and the end of the first sprint for both my mobile design class and work. Yeah, next week sure is deadly…

**What will you do next week?**

Hopefully I’ll do everything that I just mentioned above. If not, I will be doomed.

**Tip of the Week**:

Have you guys heard about the discovery of the gravitational waves? I mean, have you read the news that WE HUMANS HAVE DISCOVERED GRAVITATIONAL WAVES!? It is huge, like, HUGE! I cannot articulate how exciting I was when I found out about this. Reading how the scientists did the experiment was totally awesome. I mean, how can you not get excited when there was laser beam involved? 

If you have no idea what I’m talking about, please do yourself a favor and Google gravitational waves when you have time. If you appreciate science, you will not be disappointed.
