title: Week 5 – Yield and Generate
---
Hello, people of the Internet.


It turns out that this week wasn’t all that bad. Although my partner and I started our project late, we did manage to finish it just in time and got the RMSE down to 0.97 for the probe, which is good enough for us. Sadly, I did not find Netflix to be particularly interesting as there wasn’t a lot of coding involved. We started off trying to find the pattern, changed our strategy to doing trials and errors to find the sweet spots, and, finally, ended up using just a single line of code to improve the RMSE by 0.02, which is huge considering that it took us more than an hour to get it down to 0.99. I feel like this is more of a math project than a CS one. That being said, this project does make me appreciate how easy it is to deal with strings in Python. I still find the whole incorrect tabbing thing to be irritating and I absolutely hate Python for that. Why can’t you just use curly braces like the other languages, Python? WHY?


For the lectures, we had a more in-depth view of the Python generator and how it works with functions. I have to admit, the idea of a generator is pretty cool and Downing never ceased to amaze me with all the one-liners. I absolutely love how it stores the mechanism instead of the actual data and spits out the correct information when it’s needed. It does make me appreciate Python a little bit more, although I wonder if the compilers for most of the other languages already optimize this for you. This kind of things doesn’t get any less magical nevertheless.


Time for the questions!


**What did you do this past week?**


I finished Netflix with my partner! I also learned a lot about generator and yield in Python and boy were the quizzes tricky.


**What’s in your way?**


The exam is less than two weeks away and I’m totally not ready. I’m going to have to dedicate a big portion of my time to studying Python to prepare for it after my algorithm exam.


**What will you do next week?**


I’m planning on implementing everything we’ve talked about in-class. Perhaps I’ll write some code in Swift to take a break from the studying.


**Tip of the Week**: 


Now that Netflix prize is over, we got a next big prize coming up! I’m talking about the (IBM AI Prize){http://www.itpro.co.uk/strategy/26071/ibm-announces-5m-ai-x-prize-competition-at-ted} that was announced this week at a TED conference. I wonder if Downing is going to create a new project based on this for the students in the 2020s. Curious…
