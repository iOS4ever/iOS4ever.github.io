title: Week 3 – Exception 
---  
Hello, good students. 
 
*“80% of success is just showing up”* – Woody Allen 
 
To be a good student, you should never skip your classes. Downing made it very clear that we should all show up for the lectures if we want to excel in our classes. 
 
Downing also said that we should move heaven and earth to get an internship in summer, so I guess it goes like this: 
 
```
  try: 
    goToClass() 
  except (CareerFair): 
    tryToGetAJob() 
  else: 
    noJob() 
  finally: 
    lifeContinues()
```
 
Yeah, I know it’s bad pseudo code, but hey, it’s not that bad considering that it’s my first attempt of writing stupid, useless pseudo code. 
 
I went to the career fair even though I already got a summer internship as I figured some companies may be looking for full-times for next year. Sadly, most companies only have summer intern and fall full-time positions and I was told to come back in fall. That being said, I did trade in like 20 sheets of letter-sized papers for 13 t-shirts and a couple of pairs of socks. Good deal, eh? 
 
I really don’t have much to say for this semester’s career events as nothing exciting happened. I’m pleased to report that the food at the career night on Monday was way better than the bagels and OJ at the career brunch of last semester though. Yay! 
 
And this week Downing went over exception, so there’s also that. 
 
Which leads me to the questions! 
 
 
**What did you do this past week?** 
 
I went to the career night and the career fair! And I turned in Collatz and didn’t get it to pass on Sphere even though I implemented lazy caching with a metacache. 
 
I also went to uMAD – University of Mobile App Development. This is my third uMAD, which means I haven’t missed a single one, although my streak is about to end, and I feel extremely fortunate to be a part of this student-led developers conference. If everything goes according to plan, this would be my last uMAD, and I will never forget the workshops and presentations throughout the last three years. This is one of the many reasons of why I’m so proud to be a Longhorn in CS. What starts here sure changes the world. Hook ‘Em! 
 
**What’s in your way?** 

More tricky quizzes. I don’t know why, perhaps it’s the fact that most of my classes have quizzes now, but I keep missing questions because of my lack of attention to details. The only question that I really missed was from Friday regarding Python tuple, which was certainly interesting. 
 
**What will you do next week?** 

Start on project 2: Netflix! I cannot wait to finish this project so we can start working with JavaScript. I’ll also work on my algorithm homework. Daddy needs to find the liars at a ball  using a graph. 

  
**Tip of the Week**:  

Have you heard of the term “[Cargo Cult](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult)?”  It is used to describe an attempt to replicate some meaningless practices to achieve successful outcome. 
 
This leads me to [Cargo Cult Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult_programming). I feel like it is a mistake that many of us are constantly making unconsciously. As programmers, we need to understand the core of the problem that we're trying to solve through computer software and what the users really want from our programs. We should never blindly code something into our app just because it was done previously. That is simply not efficient and could potentially be harmful as it may introduce bugs into our programs. 
 
I also feel like our society does a lot of cargo cult practices, but that's another story to tell.
