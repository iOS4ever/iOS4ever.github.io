title: Week 8 – Start of Something New
---
Hello, Spring Breakers.


We finally began going over the big project of this class: a database website. What we’re supposed to do is to make a web app that is similar to IMDb with a topic of our choice. This is the project that I had been looking forward to as it involves JavaScript. Although my work involves JS, I’m still very new to the language and I can’t wait to learn more about it. Many members of my group have had used it before, so it’s very exciting to me as there is so much to learn from them.


Almost forgot to mention, we chose video games as our topic because we found several good APIs that we can use and one of our members is a big gamer. I proposed Halo as our topic as I’m a huge fan and the Halo lore is absolutely gorgeous. That being said, the API that Wikia sites provide isn’t that well documented, so sadly, we had to choose our other idea. Although one of our members is very happy about the outcome.


We actually didn’t have class on Friday (yay!) and I attended the fireside chat with Max Levchin, a member of the PayPal Mafia, and Longhorn startup idea pitch. I have to say that Max is a really sharp man and it was really cool to be so close to one of the most successful humans in history. This kind of opportunity certainly is one of the best perks of being a Longhorn.


**What did you do this past week?**


We went over the project and had a lecture by an engineer from Rackspace as we’re using their thingy for our project.


**What’s in your way?**


Nothing! Because it’s spring break! Unless you wanna know what’s in my way the week after. In that case, I’m hoping to work on the project with my group.


**What will you do next week?**


Code more in Swift! I’m hoping to get our MVP out for a class I’m taking so we can actually work on some extra cool stuffs like Apple Watch and 3D Touch. Perhaps I’ll meet with my group as well for the DB project.


**Tip of the Week**: 


I guess it’s time for an update on the Google’s AlphaGO that I mentioned a few weeks ago. There’s actually a 5-game challenge match between the Google AI and one of the best Go players in the world (number 4 in the world, I think), and so far, AlphaGO had won three out of the four matches that they have played, and what that means is that AlphaGO had already sealed the victory. Some say that this is the beginning of the end of humanity. I say, no matter what the outcome for the final match is, it is a huge win for the human species. Perhaps [smart AI]( http://www.halopedia.org/Smart_AI) isn’t that sci-fi afterall.
