title: Week 9 - Lost
---
Hello.


This week we turned in our first phase of the IDB project, and I have to say, it was not a pleasant experience for me. I didn’t spend much time with my team working on the project and I basically did zero meaningful thing for them. We also turned in our project close to the deadline as we started working on it early this week as many of us had exams before spring break, so we couldn’t do anything prior to this week.


This project really upset me a lot for many reasons. I couldn’t help my team on Wednesday as I had to work on my algo homework and I feel totally shitty as I basically used them. When they encountered some problems, I really couldn’t do much as I did not know how to fix the issues, and that helplessness is absolute torture. Furthermore, I spent at least 4 hours trying to figure out Carina docker, and I simply had no idea how to use it. I followed the instruction and got it to work on my local machine, but I got lost when the instruction just said generate my image. What is it? How do I do that? To this date, I still have no idea what files are required to set up the docker, what have to be in the yml files, and how to generate the images, hell, or even what they are. What kind of snapshots are they talking about? Honestly, I have no clue. 


This is definitely my lowest point of my CS career, yet, and my emotion totally killed my quiz grade on Friday as I really wasn’t paying attention. This past week sure made me question what really is important to me. All I know is that I do not want to be in this position ever again.


**What did you do this past week?**


As I mentioned, basically nothing.


**What’s in your way?**


Everything, it seems.


**What will you do next week?**


I don’t know. I know I will be sitting in front of my computer, but what would I be doing? I have no clue.


**Tip of the Week**: 


“If you live each day as if it was your last, someday you’ll most certainly be right.”


Perhaps I should start doing that.
