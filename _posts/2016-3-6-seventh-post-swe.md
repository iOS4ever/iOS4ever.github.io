title: Week 7 – Coding is fun
---
Hello, coders.

I love coding. I really do. And this is why I think most exams in CS are pointless. Testing is there to create necessity to force people to learn things. Here in CS, we already have that driving force, and it’s our enthusiasm for CS.


I can go on and on about how I hate exams with a passion, but I’ll save that for another day. This time I’d like to talk about how much I’ve grown over the past couple of years.


When I was studying, I couldn’t help but complained about Python for the lack of normal for loop and how we’re forced to use that weird for-each loop with a range object thing. Then I noticed something: I used to find for-each loop to be incredibly confusing. I then realized that I’m now using many techniques that I used to struggle with – for-each loop, ternary operator, etc. 


I have made many friends over the past few years here in CS, we can talk just about anything. The funny thing is that whenever there is an argument about programming, we often code to prove each other wrong. Yes, we are that nerdy. Frankly, every time I think about it, it brings me joy.


I did not grow because I was forced to. I did not learn new programming languages because my professors told me to. I did not code because I need a high GPA.


There is only one explanation for why we are CS majors.


We love coding.


**What did you do this past week?**


We went over scoping in Python, or something called decorator. I also studied for the exam and took it.


**What’s in your way?**


Quizzes, yo.


**What will you do next week?**


Code in Swift, do homework for algorithm, and study for my economics exam.


**Tip of the Week**: 


Now that I’m an iOS developer (sorta), I can’t help but notice how janky it is to work with JSON with Swift. This is where [SwiftyJSON]( https://github.com/SwiftyJSON/SwiftyJSON) comes in. It makes working with JSON a breeze and everyone who's interested in iOS development needs to check it out.
