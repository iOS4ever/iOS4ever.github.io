title: Week 12 – Software Engineering
--- 
Hello, software engineering.

 
We finally wrapped up SQL on Wednesday. Since I took Data Management last semester, most, if not all, of the stuffs we went over in class were reviews for me. I do have to mention that Downing does a much better job teaching SQL and taught me more about the language than what my Data Management class did. I'm not sure if this is interesting or just downright sad.


Anyway, once we finished up SQL, we moved on to some really cool stuffs – stuffs called software engineering. We started going over refactoring – the process of changing the code structure to make it more reusable and reliable without changing the external behavior – and boy is it fun. We analyzed a sample code from the textbook (I think, although I remember Downing saying that the textbook didn't give the code and he actually wrote the code himself. Anyway, it doesn't matter) and refactor it for better reusability and minimal increase in efficiency.


The best part is that, when we were analyzing the code and Downing was going over what can be improved with refactoring techniques, I couldn’t help but keep thinking about the code I’ve written for projects from other classes and what I can do now to refactor it further. Friday’s class was definitely the best class of the semester so far and it really reminds me of why I wanted to take SWE in the first place. It seems that there are only 4 lectures left, and I truly hope that this kind of lectures is what Downing has in store for the final lectures. After all, they are my final lectures with Downing. I really hope we can end on a great note. 


**What did you do this past week?** 
 

 I tried to deploy our app to Carina again without any luck. Although it seems that we can use VM for the final stage, I kind of want to give Carina one more shot as we did get it to work last time and it seems that there’s a solution for my problem according to a post from my fellow classmate on Piazza.
 
 
**What’s in your way?** 
 
Besides the final stage of the project, I’ll have to start focusing on other non-programming classes like economics and algorithm as I need to do a giant load of homework and study for the exam on Friday. This is gonna be so fun.
 
 
**What will you do next week?** 
 
As I mentioned above, I will do the homework from algorithm and economics. I’ll also register classes for Fall and I’m really hoping that I can get all the classes I want. It is my last semester, and I really hope the department doesn’t screw me over again.
 
 
 
**Tip of the Week**:  
 
Do you like docker? [Hitler]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PivpCKEiQOQ&feature=youtu.be&ab_channel=AvishaiIsh-Shalom) doesn’t like it either.


**Tip of the Week 2**:  


Please tell me you watched the video and at the very least chuckled. Here is another tip of the week for this entry, and it’s all about digital encryption. The videos are made by GPCrey and I highly recommend them.
