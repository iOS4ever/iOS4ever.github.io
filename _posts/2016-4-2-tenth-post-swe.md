title: Week 10 – Software Development
---
Hello, software developers.


This week we went over XML, JSON, and regular expression. All I can say is that if you’re new to XML like I am, it can be really confusing. And if there happens to be a tricky quiz on it right after you first stare at it for about half an hour, you’re going to be sad. JSON, on the other hand, despite having less features than XML, is much more intuitive and is my go-to data-interchangeable format. It is basically a dictionary and it is just so much easier to use and understand. What that means is that you can use it with pretty much every language you’re familiar with. Yes, XSD has a pointer system, but you can always create that in code once you get your JSON. After all, this is why we have object-oriented programming in the first place. Besides, how good can a system be if it manages to confuse a human before it can help one?


We also had two guest speakers from Atlassian and they pretty much talked about every product of theirs. And goats. They also talked about goats. I notice that there is one common theme for the guest lectures in this semester so far, and that is agile development. I feel like the IDB project we’re working on is trying to use the same methodology; however, the fact that my team lost two points for not having a good design makes me question it as the first sprint usually focuses on the concept and the core functionality of the project, not the actual UI/UX. On the bright side, we only lost less than 3% for a not-so-pretty splash page with agile, so yay!

We started phase 2 of our IDB project.


**What’s in your way?**


Finishing phase 2 of our IDB project.


**What will you do next week?**


Do phase 2 of… you know what, you get the idea.


**Tip of the Week**: 


What happens when you piss off a developer and cause him to remove his code from the Internet? 


You may break the Internet.
