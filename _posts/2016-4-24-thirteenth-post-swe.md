title: Week 13 – the Blue Marble
--- 
Hello, uncertainty.


We finished phase 3, and guess what, a log file that serves absolutely zero purpose stabbed us.


If it weren’t for Earth Day and Carl Sagan, I’d probably just drop out and just drive across the country.


Let me move onto other more interesting and relevant things.


This week we have been going over classes and reflection in Java. To review the lectures and the language itself, I tried to do what Downing showed us in class, but then the weirdest thing happened - I couldn’t get it to work. At one point, I couldn’t even get a “Hello, World” app to run, and here I was, trying to work with the first programming language that I learned to use. What the hell happened?

I couldn’t even use Eclipse correctly. I tried importing Downing’s files directly into Eclipse to run them, but I had zero success as I keep getting some weird duplicate local variable error. In short, I don’t get Java, not anymore. I’m really amazed by the fact that this was my first programming language and yet, it’s now one of my least favorites. I feel like I’m experiencing jamais vu. Quite odd.

**What did you do this past week?** 

I tried to do Java again. It turned out that Java and I are no longer compatible.

 
**What’s in your way?** 
 
This week is very busy for me. It’s likely that our group will present in class. I also have an exam for my economics and two presentations for my mobile news app design.
 
**What will you do next week?** 
 
Do my homework, take economics exam, and present three times for two different classes. If you’re interested in our demo day stuffs, you are totally welcomed to join us on Saturday at Belo! Although I honestly have no idea why anyone would be interested in that kind of presentation.
 
 
**Tip of the Week**:  
 
It was Earth Day on Friday. It is only appropriate for this tip of the week to be Earth related. I have two tips, actually. The first one is more related to tech, and it’s a tip-of-the-week from my classmate, [Leslie]( http://leslierice.github.io/2016/04/17/Week-12.html). Those are some really cool apps that help you be more eco-conscious, and I totally recommend everyone to at least check out their app pages. I also recommend [WWF Together]( https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/wwf-together/id581920331) by the World Wildlife Fund. Unlike other educational apps, this one is very well designed and absolutely beautiful. 

My second tip is a video, or rather, a snippet of an audiobook called *Pale Blue Dot* by the legendary Carl Sagan. This video talks about the first moon landing and how the Apollo mission and its legacy inspired the future generations of humans.

Also, you should probably check out some pictures of this fragile but stunningly beautiful planet of ours.

Lastly, how can I be a Halo nerd if I don’t even share a quote from the Halo universe?
