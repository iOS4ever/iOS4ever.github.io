title: Week 11 – Expectation vs. Reality
---
Hello, truth.


I decided to only take classes that interest me for my last year in UTCS as I want to make the most out of it, besides, of course, algorithm as it is the requirement. I took SWE because I had a very productive and fun class in OOP last semester with Downing despite the quizzes and the exams, and after I heard that we would be making a website for the big project, I decided to do whatever I can to get into this class without any hesitation. I got off the waitlist a week into the semester thinking this was one of the best decisions I’ve ever made, and all I had been waiting for was to start doing the IDB project. I thought I was going to learn so much and would be able to acquire the skills to make a beautiful website. SWE was one of the two classes that made me want to come to UT every week for this semester.


That was my expectation.


Then there comes the actuality. So far, the IDB project is one of the most painful projects I’ve ever worked on. I am the kind of person who actually enjoyed working on Pintos in operating system even though we had to spend almost 35 hours per week to finish it a week before the deadline. I enjoyed it because I knew what I was coding and I absolutely loved working with my team and the TAs. There was always that satisfaction when we finished the project.


IDB is very different. There are so many new things we need to learn without anyone’s guidance that make the learning curve of this project insanely high. Furthermore, the set up for our app, i.e., the docker, was absolutely excruciating. I spent hours, not coding project, not providing my ideas to my team, not trying to finish the application itself, but trying to get the docker up and running. Our team had no idea that we were supposed to use Rackspace’s sample Python web app as a template for it to make deploying a smoother, simpler task. How could we have known? No body told us that. We didn’t even know what a docker was. At least now I finally know why almost every team has a similar app structure and ours is so different. Even without the docker part, it is still a very difficult project with all the technologies that we have to use. All the information that we’ve learned from the lectures is pretty much useless, which is very much different from OOP. Yes, we mentioned the decorator, but I still do not know it well enough to use it properly to set up the backend. And even if I do, I still don’t know enough about React or Angular to be an effective programmer. Honestly, I’m not even a programmer for this project. I’m more like a prayer who tried his best to set up Carina by spending hours doing the same thing over and over again.


I knew that Downing would not lecture on JavaScript before I registered as that was the information I received from my friend, and I guess I really had no idea what that really meant.


I’ve always loved working on projects because they are why I fell in love with CS in the first place. I truly love solving problems with this binary language. Although it is really cool to know the entire software stack in an academic project, I guess it might just be too much for me to handle especially when I have to spend a lot of time elsewhere.


In the past, this blog post would be about how much I cannot wait to start the final project and how sad it is that the semester is coming to an end and perhaps I can get an A in the class.


Now, I just hope that we can get an okay website running for the final stage and get, hopefully, a B. But then again, grade really doesn’t matter. I really should stop trying as it’s just so pointless now.


**What did you do this past week?**


I spent a little time coding for the project and many, many, many hours on setting up Carina docker.


**What’s in your way?**


SWE is in my way. Man, I am still shocked that I’m saying this.


**What will you do next week?**


Well, if my group does not start working on the project, I’ll spend some time working on my iOS app. I think I also have an algo homework to do. Crap.


**Tip of the Week**: 


This is one small landing of a rocket ship, one giant leap for human space exploration.


Humanity has done it. WE have done it.
