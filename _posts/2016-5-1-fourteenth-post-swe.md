title: Week 14 – Almost There
--- 
Hello, exams.

Yes, I have two exams coming up – one algo and one SWE. I’m gonna die.

Anyway, let me talk about this week of class a little bit before I dive back into the study rabbit hole.

We had our last quiz on Monday, and boy I am so glad that it was in Python and not Java. We also presented our project on Friday and I think it went pretty smoothly. I’m also really impressed with others’ sites as they all look really polished. I don’t want to spoil much, but I know one team has an amazing splash page and they have not yet presented, so people in the afternoon section, stay tuned. 


**What did you do this past week?** 

I **finally** watched the Force Awakens on Thursday, and I LOVE IT. And yes, I presented with my group in SWE on Friday. There was also another presentation that I was involved in on Saturday for another class, which I will talk about below.
 
**What’s in your way?** 
 
Holy crap exams!

**What will you do next week?** 
 
Study for the holy crap exams!
 
**Tip of the Week**:  
 
Saturday was UT Apps Demo Day in the school of journalism for my class Mobile News App Design. My team actually got a snapchat filter approved for the venue and it was totally awesome!

Anyway, the class has six teams, each team is made of CS and journalism majors and all of our apps made it to the App Store. The demo day went really smoothly and I think everyone of us enjoyed this journey very much. If you’re interested in how the presentations went, you can go to Twitter and search #UTApps to find out more.

There are five awards at the end and the best overall app award was given to a bus tracking app called Clutch, and I have to say that I agree with the judges as I personally use their app and think it is immensely helpful. That being said, I will post not only a link to their app, but every app from our class as we all worked pretty hard and y’all should totally check them out (including ours!).
