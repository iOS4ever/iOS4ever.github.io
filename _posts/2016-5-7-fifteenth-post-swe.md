title: Week 15 – Final Thoughts
--- 

Hello, world.

No, this is not my last semester. I graduate in December, so I’ll be around for a while. That being said, it does feel like the end of school as many are graduating and I’m done with all CS prerequisites. I can’t wait to start my internship at Spiceworks and see what I can do there in just a couple of weeks.

I can spend another blog post talking about the issues I have with this course like I did with OOP, but since most of the points are the same, I think I should talk about something else. How about the questions I had at the end of OOP that I wished to answer but couldn’t?

Why do I like writing a blog now? It’s weird because I’m not a writer and I never really enjoyed typing stuff that are mostly human-readable. Well, it turns out that it feels great to be able to write out my thoughts sometimes, and the fact that I know some people are reading them is also pretty cool. Of course, the latter wouldn’t be the case in the future if I do decide to have an actual blog, but I can always just write a journal from now on and it’s nice to be able to just scroll through what I wrote to see what I did and how I felt about things. It’s a neat nice record to keep and I do intend to write more. Although I may want to spend more time checking my posts in the future so I can improve my writing skill as well.

Another question I asked at the end of OOP was why do I like being called on in class? It turns out that it’s really not stressful at all. Instead, the fact that the instructor is calling on the students in the room really engages me. Not because it forces you to concentrate so you don’t get embarrassed if you get called on, I seriously cannot careless, but because you constantly try to answer the questions the speaker is asking even if it is not directed to you. It helps me focus in class and actually keeps me awake and learn. Now I just wish that every class that has lectures can do this. Of course, because of Downing’s style, you would always get out of the room with a very good understanding of the material as he wants the students to have a solid knowledge and not just a vague interpretation.

I guess I should still talk a few points about the cons of Downing’s classes. For example, many people I know dropped OOP because of the 20% penalty for the projects. Many of them lost those points not because their programs didn’t work, but because they didn’t turn in the requirements like the log file. Those requirements do make turning in the projects very nerve-wracking and I always at least triple check them before I turn them in. It really gives you OCD and, honestly, they are unnecessarily stressful. And of course, I have fallen victim to the log file this semester myself for the final stage. The IDB project was really dreadful for me and my group, and, for some reasons, we just forgot to check our repo as we only concentrated on making the site work and turning in a valid JSON. Yes, in the real world, you do get punished for making mistakes, but a log is really irrelevant to the projects and the graders don’t even need it, so why is it a requirement in the first place? And 20% is really excessive and unreasonable. I say a 5% is more appropriate. Of course, because the grading scheme for this class is broken as projects worth very little, my rank only dropped to 14 from 7 because of that 20%, which is very ironic as the grading scheme actually worked in my favor in this case. So yeah, maybe I can still get an A after all. 

One thing on the blog: it seems that my OOP class was more engaging than this SWE class according to [Google Analytics]( https://onedrive.live.com/redir?resid=97A5750B77CBF807!24972&authkey=!AJO7z7uikVXgX5U&ithint=file%2cpdf), although I’m questioning GA’s accuracy as there are a few spikes during the winter break, which totally doesn’t make any sense. And of course, Mac users are the best readers!

**Tip of the Week**

Since this is the last post for this blog, I’d like to share a few of my favorite videos that I watch monthly, if not weekly, that keep me going in life.

The first one is the [2005 Stanford Commencement Speech]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF8uR6Z6KLc&ab_channel=Stanford) given by Steve Jobs. I used to watch it every day when I was in high school, and it is still the best commencement speech ever in my opinion. It is very short, yet incredibly inspiring.

The second one is the Pale Blue Dot by Carl Sagan. It is perhaps the best speech ever as it highlights the fallibility of our species and our place in this universe and pushes us forward. It shows the beauty of our planet and our responsibility as the greatest species on Earth. If Benjamin Franklin was the first American, Carl Sagan was the first human. This video is why I wake up everyday and I truly believe it is what we need to unify our species.

Sadly, the video got taken down because of some copyright issue on YouTube. Lucky for you, I made a copy! Wait, I think someone had said this before. I wonder who… Anyway, [here]( https://onedrive.live.com/redir?resid=97A5750B77CBF807!24963&authkey=!AOBjzdHiZ7N93WQ&ithint=video%2cmp4) it is.

Of course, how can I end this blog without a quote?

“You don’t seem excited. This is the high point of the entire god damn class!”
