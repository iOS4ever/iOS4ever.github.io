The name is Jerry Pon. I'm a Longhorn studying computer science. I'm currently taking Software Engineering with Dr. Downing. I'll update this blog at least once a week to share my experience in this class.

### More Information

*I don't know who you are. I don't know what you want. But what I do have are a very particular set of skills; skills I have acquired over my time at UTCS. Skills that make me a nightmare for people like you. If you don't send me junk mail, that'll be the end of it. I will not look for you, I will not pursue you. But if you do, I will look for you, I will find you, and I will delete you. Please don't send junk mail.
